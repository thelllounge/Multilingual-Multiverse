            <p class="intro">
                There were six alternative foreign language promo cards that were printed in Magic: the Gathering.
            </p>
            <p>The first set of promo cards were all multicolored cards from the Invasion block. These cards were given out for attending a prerelease tournament and each card has 
                the date of the the prerelease on the type line of the card. All of these cards are written in ancient languages.

               The second set of alternative langauge promo cards were monocolored cards from the Odyssey block. These cards, like the others, were given out as prerelease rewards
               for those who attended and once gain of the dates on the type line of the card. These cards were printed in languages that have heavy association with religion.
               While at the time Russian was not a core language the game was printed in, and was at the time the only Russian card, it would later be added to the langauges all major sets are printed in.
