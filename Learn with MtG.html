        <p>On this page we're eventually going to have a few things. Perhaps it will include
            a game that will be played so you can practice vocabulary in Magic the Gathering.
            Perhaps it will only have a grid of vocabulary that you might want to learn in your
            target language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps it won't have any of that and I'll find something else to do with the information
            I've been gathering very slowly over the years about the different vocabulary words
            that one might need to know while playing Magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now though, It will just have this because I want to put something here but I'm
            really unsure. None of my charts are complete enough to be worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could just do colors or something as a trial run. Maybe I'll work on that tomorrow.
